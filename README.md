# Infected

Infected changes the stage-based default horror gamemode of **[Secret Laboratory](https://store.steampowered.com/app/700330/SCP_Secret_Laboratory/)** into a remake of Call of Duty's original **Infected** gamemode. The mode is locked to the *upper-levels**, where all players but one will be Facility Guards, while the remaining player is a pestilence resuscitation, the **"Zombie"**. The **zombie** has an unlimited amount of respawns, and each time they kill a **Facility Guards**, their victim joins their team as a pestilence resuscitation. The game ends if the surviving **Facility Guards** reach the escape helicopter, or if the **zombies** kill all **Facility Guards**.

Built for pre-scocophobia **Exiled 1.12.24** (July 27 For Beta XVII) but may work with more recent builds.
The rescue chopper might break the server.
